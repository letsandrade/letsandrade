üëã Hey there! I'm Leticia, but you can call me Lets üöÄ\
I'm a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer based in Brazil üáßüá∑, driven by a love for learning and crafting meaningful web experiences. I‚Äôm always improving, and I‚Äôm passionate about working with modern technologies to build projects that are simple, fast, and user-friendly. If you're into all things code, technology, and UX‚Äîyou're in the right place!

üí° A Bit About Me\
I‚Äôm comfortable working across the full stack, with a strong focus on clean code and thoughtful design. Although there's always more to explore, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôve spent most of my time:

Languages:
üéØ JavaScript (my main love), TypeScript, plus some PHP, Java, and Python in the mix!

Frontend Development:
My frontend work centers on React and TailwindCSS, building interfaces that are both functional and elegant. I‚Äôve also used Next.js, Vue, and Vite to enhance the performance and scalability of my projects.
For animations, GSAP and Three.js have been my tools of choice, helping me add subtle motion and interactivity where it counts.

Backend Development:
On the backend, I use Node.js to handle server-side logic, and I‚Äôm comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL databases, with MySQL being the one I‚Äôm most familiar with.

Deployment:
I‚Äôve deployed projects using Vercel and also have experience managing VPS Hosting environments with Apache and cPanel, ensuring applications run smoothly.

üå± What I'm Focused On\
Lately, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into backend architecture, striving to build scalable, maintainable systems that don‚Äôt sacrifice performance. On the frontend, I‚Äôm always seeking out new ways to enhance user interactions, with a focus on seamless animations and intuitive design.

Every project is an opportunity to grow, and I approach each one with a mindset of continuous improvement.
